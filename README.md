The points are generated in the two-dimensional space with coordinates ranging from -5000 to +5000. Each generated point has unique coordinates and belongs to one of 4 classes, these classes being: red (R), green (G), blue (B) and purple (P). Initially, 5 points for each class (20 points in total) are created at fixed positions in the space. All subsequent points are assigned random coordinates.

The program contains a classifier for points which classifies each point based on k-NN algorithm, adds this point to the 2D space (with color according to the classification) and returns the class it assigned for the newly added point. The effectiveness of the classifier is measured in a testing environment which alternately generates points of each type and compares the return value of the classifier with the type assigned to the point at its creation.
